## Tools Used
- [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) For making Single Page Application and it's User Interface.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) My preferred code editor.

## My Approach
As per the challenge, we can divide our webpage into six, High-level components :
- `Navbar Component` 
- `SectionOne Component`
- `SectionTwo Component`
- `SectionThree Component`
- `SectionFour Component`
- `Footer Component`
As its a simple webpage with very few repetitive items, I  used map function to  repeat various elements in components.
for example , Navbar & Footer Menu items and List items  where ever possible.
